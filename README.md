# Used-LinkedList-for-Queue-Stack
Using LinkedList method for making Queue and Stack,

Linked Lists are a very common way of storing arrays of data. The major benefit of linked lists is that you do not specify a fixed size for your list. The more elements you add to the chain, the bigger the chain gets.

## Queue
Queue is Collection of entities or elements in which addition of element is done at REAR and removal of element is done at FRONT.
Queue follows FIFO (First in First out) - means the first element added to the queue will be the first one to removed.

## Stack
Stack is a linear data structure which implements data on last in first out (LIFO )criteria.
